# Different machine learning models

We have created five different machine learning models based on libraries in MATLAB. These include SVM, KNN, Decision tree, BiLSTM without sliding window, and BiLSTM with sliding window.

|  | Classification Types | Main algorithms | Applied datasets |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Model 1 |Traditional individual sample classification | SVM | Group 1 and 4 (Shuffled) |
| Model 2 |  | KNN | Group 1 and 4 (Shuffled) |
| Model 3 |  | Decision Tree | Group 1 and 4 (Shuffled) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Model 4 | Sequential classification | BiLSTM without sliding window | Group 1 and 4 (Without shuffle) |
| Model 5 |  | BiLSTM with sliding window | Group 2, 3, 5, 6 (Shuffled)	|
